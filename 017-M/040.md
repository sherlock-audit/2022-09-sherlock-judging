# Griefing attack is possible via TrueFi borrowing

## Summary

As TrueFiStrategy net asset value reported with _balanceOf() depends on the TrueFi liquidity situation, which can be modified by any user eligible for TrueFi loans, a griefing attack of borrowing right ahead of Sherlock requesting NAV figure from the strategy is possible.

## Vulnerability Detail

On observing a Sherlock's redeemNFT() or arbRestake() from Bob the target user, Alice the attacker will front run his transaction with borrow() call, reducing the amount of liquid funds a TrueFiPool2 has, immediately repaying her debt right afterwards. I.e. Alice will become a short term debtor for sandwiching Bob's redeemNFT(). Alice needs to be whitelisted as a borrower, which is achievable, and her status will not be affected by this attack and examined alone her actions are legitimate, i.e. she only takes are repays short-term loan, which is valid usage of TrueFi.

As loan term is small the overall cost of the attack (that consists of the loan interest along with gas costs for borrow and repay transactions) isn't substantial for Alice, while Bob can incur big enough slippage as TrueFiStrategy's _balanceOf() will observe low `liquidValue()` and thus high `liquidExitPenalty(totalAmount)` of the TrueFiPool2, diminishing the value of the Bob's withdrawal. Alice can repeat this many times over with various Sherlock users.

## Impact

Sherlock stakers who unstaked will incur higher fees proportionally to the current TrueFi liquidity situation and the budget Alice have for the attack (with increased budget she can do it more frequently and take bigger loans, moving liquidity more substantially).

## Code Snippet

There are two agencies that can be used for borrowing, FixedTermLoanAgency and LineOfCreditAgency, and Alice needs to become an allowed borrower in either of them:

FixedTermLoanAgency:

```solidity
    function allowBorrower(address who) external onlyOwner {
        isBorrowerAllowed[who] = true;
        emit BorrowerAllowed(who);
    }
```

https://github.com/trusttoken/contracts-pre22/blob/986fefb91fb0619217d17ecf0b4c5b7b921130ed/contracts/truefi2/FixedTermLoanAgency.sol#L327-L351

```solidity
    function borrow(
        ITrueFiPool2 pool,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 term,
        uint256 _maxApy
    ) external onlyAllowedBorrowers {
        require(poolFactory.isSupportedPool(pool), "FixedTermLoanAgency: Pool not supported by the factory");
        require(poolLoans[pool].length < maxLoans, "FixedTermLoanAgency: Loans number has reached the limit");

        address borrower = msg.sender;
        require(borrowingMutex.isUnlocked(borrower), "FixedTermLoanAgency: There is an ongoing loan or credit line");
        require(
            creditOracle.status(borrower) == ITrueFiCreditOracle.Status.Eligible,
            "FixedTermLoanAgency: Sender is not eligible for loan"
        );

        require(amount > 0, "FixedTermLoanAgency: Loans of amount 0, will not be approved");
        require(
            pool.oracle().tokenToUsd(amount) <= borrowLimit(pool, borrower),
            "FixedTermLoanAgency: Loan amount cannot exceed borrow limit"
        );

        require(term > 0, "FixedTermLoanAgency: Loans cannot have instantaneous term of repay");
        require(isTermBelowMax(term), "FixedTermLoanAgency: Loan's term is too long");
        require(isCredibleForTerm(term), "FixedTermLoanAgency: Credit score is too low for loan's term");
```

LineOfCreditAgency:

https://github.com/trusttoken/contracts-pre22/blob/986fefb91fb0619217d17ecf0b4c5b7b921130ed/contracts/truefi2/LineOfCreditAgency.sol#L236-L240

```solidity
    /// @dev set borrower `who` to whitelist status `isAllowed`
    function allowBorrower(address who, bool isAllowed) external onlyOwner {
        isBorrowerAllowed[who] = isAllowed;
        emit BorrowerAllowed(who, isAllowed);
    }
```

https://github.com/trusttoken/contracts-pre22/blob/986fefb91fb0619217d17ecf0b4c5b7b921130ed/contracts/truefi2/LineOfCreditAgency.sol#L380-L395

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Borrow from `pool` for `amount` using lines of credit
     * Only whitelisted borrowers that meet all requirements can borrow
     * @param pool Pool to borrow from
     * @param amount Amount of tokens to borrow
     */
    function borrow(ITrueFiPool2 pool, uint256 amount) external onlyAllowedBorrowers {
        require(poolFactory.isSupportedPool(pool), "LineOfCreditAgency: The pool is not supported for borrowing");
        require(amount > 0, "LineOfCreditAgency: Borrowed amount has to be greater than 0");
        require(
            creditOracle.status(msg.sender) == ITrueFiCreditOracle.Status.Eligible,
            "LineOfCreditAgency: Sender not eligible to borrow"
        );
        require(!_hasOverdueInterest(pool, msg.sender), "LineOfCreditAgency: Sender has overdue interest in this pool");
        uint8 rawScore = creditOracle.score(msg.sender);
        require(rawScore >= minCreditScore, "LineOfCreditAgency: Borrower has credit score below minimum");
```

However, this is one time requirement and the attack itself doesn't look malicious, i.e. Alice uses ultra short term borrowing in a flash loan manner, paying the interest, there is no violation in Truefi2 use cases, so becoming an allowed borrower once Alice can perform the attack many times over an extended period of time.

As Alice will seek the easiest path, the FixedTermLoanAgency that doesn't require credit scores for short term borrowing looks the most suitable:

https://github.com/trusttoken/contracts-pre22/blob/986fefb91fb0619217d17ecf0b4c5b7b921130ed/contracts/truefi2/FixedTermLoanAgency.sol#L525-L527

```solidity
    function isCredibleForTerm(uint256 term) internal view returns (bool) {
        return term <= longTermLoanThreshold || creditOracle.score(msg.sender) >= longTermLoanScoreThreshold;
    }
```

https://github.com/trusttoken/contracts-pre22/blob/986fefb91fb0619217d17ecf0b4c5b7b921130ed/contracts/truefi2/FixedTermLoanAgency.sol#L206

```solidity
        longTermLoanThreshold = 90 days;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As this is design specifics only partial remediation looks viable. As an example, some delay can be introduced in the TrueFi between loan request and funds transfer. It will not impact valid use cases, but close this attack surface.
