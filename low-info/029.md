# Non-USDC ERC20 tokens, which are accidentally sent to the `EulerStrategy` or `TrueFiStrategy` contract, cannot be transferred to `core`

## Summary
The ERC20 tokens, which are not USDC, that are accidentally sent to the `EulerStrategy` or `TrueFiStrategy` contract cannot be transferred to `core`.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown in the Code Snippet section, calling the `EulerStrategy._withdrawAll`, `EulerStrategy._withdraw`, `TrueFiStrategy._withdrawAll`, and `TrueFiStrategy._withdraw` functions can transfer the corresponding amounts of `want` to `core`. Because `want` is specified to be USDC, it is not possible to transfer any non-USDC ERC20 tokens to `core` that are accidentally sent to the `EulerStrategy` or `TrueFiStrategy` contract.

## Impact
Since these ERC20 tokens, which are not USDC, that are accidentally sent to the `EulerStrategy` or `TrueFiStrategy` contract cannot be transferred to `core`, the senders who accidentally sent them cannot get them back and would lose them forever.

      // Withdraw all underlying using max, this will translate to the full balance
      // https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/blob/master/contracts/BaseLogic.sol#L387
      EUSDC.withdraw(SUB_ACCOUNT, type(uint256).max);
    }

    // Amount of USDC in the contract
    // This can be >0 even if eUSDC balance = 0
    // As it could have been transferred to this contract by accident
    amount = want.balanceOf(address(this));
    // Transfer USDC to core
    if (amount != 0) want.safeTransfer(core, amount);
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In each of the `EulerStrategy` and `TrueFiStrategy` contracts, a function can be added for transferring the contract's balance of a specified ERC20 token, which is not USDC, to `core`.
