# Loss of funds with high liquidExitPenalty

## Summary

A high `liquidExitPenalty` fee percentage in the TrueFi protocol can result in a loss of user funds. The issue is that only the Sherlock contract owner can set the `yieldStrategy` in use and call `liquidExit` to withdraw funds from TrueFi. A withdrawal from the TrueFi yield strategy with unfavorable withdrawal fees can occur in the event that `yieldStrategy` is set to TrueFi and `liquidExit` is called with high withdrawal fees. This could be done intentionally by a rogue admin (centralization risk) but it can also happen in a benign manner when many users want to withdraw funds at the same time and USDC must be made available to them, regardless of the exit penalty fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

TrueFi has [a variable withdrawal fee](https://docs.truefi.io/faq/how-it-works/lending-on-truefi/pool/withdrawing-funds). The specific numbers are [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXGRxunIwe0eYPu7j4QjCwXxe63tNKtpCvRiJnqK0jo/edit?usp=sharing), with a maximum fee of 10%. There is a [large comment block](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-v2-core/blob/355c70df23aa9aa7d46567c9540a6d15be93fcab/contracts/strategy/TrueFiStrategy.sol#L23-L50) in the TrueFi strategy explaining how this strategy will keep the withdrawal fee small. The problem underlying this strategy as it is coded is that a withdrawal at the wrong time can result in substantial loss of user funds. In a worse case scenario, it could lead to a bank run where some users are unable to get their deposits back because so much is lost to fee.

There is another substantial risk in lending to the TrueFi protocol. The risk is that TrueFi borrowers do not pay back their undercollateralized loans. This risk is clearly identified in [the TrueFi documentation](https://docs.truefi.io/faq/how-it-works/lending-on-truefi/pool#what-are-the-risks-involved-in-lending-to-the-truefi-lending-pool). While this risk may be unlikely with the current list of TrueFi borrowers, Sherlock must monitor new borrowers in the TrueFi ecosystem over time to assure that the risk level remains low.

## Impact

The TrueFi strategy can result in loss of user deposits in certain circumstances.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The TrueFi strategy is higher risk than other strategies for Sherlock staking. This level of risk may not be acceptable to some users because of the risk of loss of funds. If this strategy is to be used, Sherlock must insure its deposits in TrueFi to avoid losing user's deposits because Sherlock's reputation is on the line.
