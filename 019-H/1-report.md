# TrueFi double loan

## Summary

Although TrueFi has KYC on the entity, the on chain loan and off chain are separate. If the company apply for a loan through TrueFi, and at the same time, apply for another loan off chain, before the loan is released and shown up on the balance sheet, it is not likely to be known. If both loan get approved, the company might be under collateralized. If a company conducts something like this, it is likely they do it on purpose to cheat for the loan and default later.


## Impact

When a company apply for loans on chain and off chain in parallel, and later default, the contract will suffer loss. Due to the off chain legal process might not put on chain contracts on priority.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Purchase on chain insurance against TrueFi loss.
